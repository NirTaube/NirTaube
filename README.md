## Professional Background
Hello Hiring Team!
My Name is Nir, ( Like not far ). Living most my life in the United States, but have lived in Uruguay and Israel As well.

Spearheading the launch of 7 stores, overseeing everything from hiring to operational setup.
Implementing a new POS & CRM system, marking a significant 10% uptick in customer retention.
My analytical prowess doesn't end with retail strategy. With 5+ years as a Data Analyst, I've distilled complex data into insightful, actionable business strategies. This technical expertise complements my leadership skills, having collaborated with C-level executives and achieved a stellar 30% sales revenue boost for a jewelry venture in a mere 3 years.

I'm not just a strategist; I'm a trailblazer in implementing data-driven platforms known for propelling teams and elevating KPIs. At my core, I'm passionate about maximizing my team's potential, a trait that's led to collective successes throughout my career.
